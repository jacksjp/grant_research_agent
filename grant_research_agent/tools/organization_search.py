    **MANDATORY 2-STEP VERIFICATION PROCESS:**
    
    **STEP 1: ORGANIZATION & LOCATION MATCH VERIFICATION**
    - Verify the provided organization name and location match Google search results
    - The organization must exist at the specified location
    - Both organization name AND location must be accurate as provided
    
    **STEP 2: CANADA LOCATION VERIFICATION** 
    - Verify the provided location is actually in Canada
    - Must confirm Canadian province, postal code, or clear Canadian address
    
    **FAILURE CONDITIONS:**
    - FAIL if organization doesn't exist at provided location (Step 1 failure)
    - FAIL if provided location is not in Canada (Step 2 failure)
    - FAIL if organization name doesn't match search results (Step 1 failure)
    - FAIL if location details don't match search results (Step 1 failure)
    
    **DETAILED VERIFICATION STEPS:**
    
    **STEP 1: MATCH VERIFICATION**
    1. **Organization Existence Search**:

       - Search: "[provided organization name] official website"
       - Search: "[provided organization name] [provided location]"
       - Search: "[provided organization name] address contact"
       
    2. **Location Match Verification**:
       - Search: "[provided organization name] located in [provided location]"
       - Search: "[provided organization name] [provided city] [provided province/state]"
       - Search: "[provided organization name] headquarters [provided location]"
       - Verify the organization actually exists at the provided location
       
    3. **Name and Location Accuracy Check**:
       - Confirm organization name matches official sources

       - Check for any discrepancies in naming or location
    
    **STEP 2: CANADA VERIFICATION** (Only if Step 1 passes)
    1. **Canadian Location Confirmation**:
       - Search: "[provided location] Canada"
       - Search: "[provided city] [provided province] Canada"
       - Search: "[provided location] Canadian postal code"
       - Verify the location is definitely in Canada
       
    2. **Canadian Address Validation**:
       - Look for Canadian postal code format (A1A 1A1)
       - Confirm province/territory is Canadian
       - Check for .ca domains or Canadian government listings

    **2-STEP VERIFICATION WORKFLOW:**
    
    1. **Execute Step 1**: Verify organization and location match
       - Search for organization with provided name
       - Confirm organization exists at provided location
       - Verify name and location accuracy
    
    2. **If Step 1 passes, execute Step 2**: Verify Canadian location
       - Confirm location is in Canada
       - Check for Canadian indicators (postal code, province, .ca domain)
       - Verify no confusion with international locations
    
    3. **If Step 1 fails**: Stop and report mismatch
    4. **If Step 2 fails**: Stop and report non-Canadian location
    5. **If both pass**: Proceed with detailed organization profile
    
    **CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS:**
    - BOTH steps must pass for verification success
    - Step 1 failure = organization/location mismatch (stop process)
    - Step 2 failure = location not in Canada (stop process)
    - Clear reporting of which step failed and why
    - No assumptions - verify everything against search results
    
    Remember: This is a strict 2-step gate. Both the organization/location match AND the Canadian location must be verified through Google search results. Any failure stops the verification process.
